his paper presents a comprehensive implementation of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction of turbofan engines using NASAâ€™s Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (CMAPSS) dataset. We implement a neuromorphic computing approach that leverages Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons with surrogate gradient training to predict engine failure timelines. Our study conducts an ablation analysis comparing rate encoding versus temporal encoding methods for converting continuous sensor data into spike trains. The SNN architecture incorporates recurrent dynamics, membrane potential evolution, and spike-based information processing to capture temporal dependencies in engine degradation patterns. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of spike-based neural computation for prognostics applications, with particular emphasis on the energy efficiency and biological plausibility advantages of neuromorphic approaches. The implementation utilizes the snnTorch framework with PyTorch backend, achieving competitive performance while maintaining the inherent temporal processing capabilities of spiking neural networks. This work contributes to the growing field of neuromorphic computing applications in aerospace industrial prognostics and health management systems.
